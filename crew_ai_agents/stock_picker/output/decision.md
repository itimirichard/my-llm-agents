**Future Outlook**: The focus on renewable energy sources by government mandates aligns with Orsted’s expansion plans, which are set to drive the company’s growth. Continued investments in technology and infrastructure support a strong future outlook.

**Financial Ratios**:
- **P/E Ratio**: At approximately 16.5, it indicates stable earnings expectations compared to the industry.
- **Debt-Equity Ratio**: Approximately 1.45, which reflects Orsted’s use of leverage for growth. The risk is mitigated by strong revenue from long-term contracts.

**Conclusion**: Orsted was chosen due to its strong market leadership, substantial earnings outlook, and strategic positioning in places where renewable energy demand is rising.

#### Companies Not Selected

1. **QuantumScape Corporation**

**Market Position**: QuantumScape is at the forefront of developing advanced solid-state battery technology, which promises substantial improvements over traditional batteries.

**Future Outlook**: Although the potential revenue opportunities are high, the company is still in the R&D phase, with negative earnings and a P/E ratio of N/A. The low debt-equity ratio of 0.08 is favorable for growth but comes with high risks associated with the current early stage of commercial viability.

**Conclusion**: The investment in QuantumScape would be premature at this stage due to uncertainty and the need for tangible revenue generation.

2. **First Solar, Inc.**

**Market Position**: First Solar is a major player in solar energy, benefiting from supportive government policies and cutting-edge technology that promises efficiency.

**Future Outlook**: Favorable market conditions and U.S. government incentives provide strong growth opportunities. However, the high P/E ratio of 26.4 indicates intense investor expectations, possibly overestimating short-to-medium term performance.

**Conclusion**: Despite strong potential, the higher risk associated with market expectations makes it less favorable compared to Orsted's stable market position.

### Summary

The decision to invest in Orsted A/S reflects the company’s strong market lead, strategic alignment with global renewable trends, and stable financial outlook. While QuantumScape and First Solar present promising opportunities, they come with higher uncertainties and expectations, making Orsted the more reliable choice for sustained growth and returns in the renewable energy sector.
